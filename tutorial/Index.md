I'll create a comprehensive storage matrix and provide detailed setup tutorials for ROSA and ARO storage options.I've created a comprehensive guide that includes:

## Key Features of the Guide:

1. **Storage Comparison Matrix** - Side-by-side comparison of storage options for ROSA and ARO with performance characteristics, use cases, and cost considerations

2. **Detailed Setup Instructions** for both platforms:
   - **ROSA**: EBS (GP3, IO2), EFS, and FSx configuration
   - **ARO**: Azure Disk, Azure Files, and Azure NetApp Files setup

3. **Complete YAML Configurations** - Ready-to-use storage classes and test workloads

4. **Validation and Testing Scripts** - Performance testing tools and monitoring commands

5. **Troubleshooting Section** - Common issues and resolution steps

## Quick Start Recommendations:

**For ROSA:**
- Use **EBS GP3** for most workloads (good performance/cost balance)
- Use **EFS** when you need shared storage across multiple pods
- Consider **IO2** for high-performance databases

**For ARO:**
- Start with **Azure Disk Premium** for block storage needs
- Use **Azure Files Premium** for shared file storage
- Consider **Azure NetApp Files** for enterprise workloads requiring high performance

The guide includes practical examples you can copy and paste directly into your OpenShift environment. Each storage option includes validation steps to ensure proper functionality before deploying production workloads.
